MongoDB and Microsoft are committing to a broad range of initiatives to make it easier for customers to advance their cloud adoption journeys, including easier access to MongoDB Atlas within the Microsoft commercial marketplace. Millions of developers who access the Azure portal will be able to discover and use MongoDB Atlas.\n",
            "As part of the agreement, MongoDB will work with Microsoft to enhance how customers experience MongoDB Atlas running on Azure by delivering go-to-market initiatives and creating developer enablement and training programs. Additionally, MongoDB will deepen their technology integrations with Microsoft to better serve their mutual customers.\n",
            "The strategic partnership agreement follows recent collaborations between the two companies announced at Microsoft Ignite, which included a pay-as-you-go MongoDB Atlas offering. MongoDB Atlas currently integrates with first-party Microsoft services such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Event Hub, Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Purview, Azure Logic Apps, and Microsoft Power Automate.\n",
            "With today’s announcement, other integrations under development will include Microsoft data, AI and analytics, and low-code services. MongoDB has also partnered with Microsoft for Startups to provide free MongoDB Atlas credits, and other benefits as a featured offer in Founders Hub. Together, MongoDB and Microsoft offer startups the speed, unlimited scale, and security they need to move from ideation to growth.\n",
            "Used by 95 of the Fortune 100, Mural—a leading collaborative intelligence company that helps its customers to power ideation, team building, education, and alignment—migrated its platform to MongoDB Atlas on Azure in 2019. Since that time, MongoDB Atlas has enabled Mural to keep up with the massive growth the company has experienced, particularly in the last two years, without adding headcount.\n",
            "“Looking at the software landscape today, everyone wants to stitch together all of their different software solutions with whatever platforms they’re on. When a really rich partner ecosystem exists, and brings value by integrating foundational services, it enables organizations like ours to deliver powerful new services to our customers,” said Rebecca Campbell, Vice President of Engineering at Mural. “Working with MongoDB on Azure has enabled us to build and ship faster, and ultimately to provide more value to our customers.”\n",
            "“As more products and services come together on the Microsoft commercial marketplace, customers get a better experience by being able to streamline their billing and procurement process,” said Alan Chhabra, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Partners and Asia at MongoDB. “Many of our customers want to run MongoDB Atlas on Azure, but have lacked the proper incentives and a smooth deployment experience. Through this expanded collaboration with Microsoft, we’re making it easier for our customers to seamlessly integrate MongoDB Atlas into their Azure infrastructure to power the next generation of applications.”\n",
            "“Developers are the key to creating the innovations that drive enhanced customer experiences,” said Arun Ulagaratchagan, CVP, Azure Data at Microsoft. “MongoDB is loved by developers all over the world, and in order to better serve our customers, we’re expanding our business and technical partnership in order to provide a best-in-class MongoDB experience with MongoDB Atlas on Azure”\n",

            "Today, as EUV technology becomes broadly adopted in leading-edge technologies, the multi-beam mask writing tools required to create advanced EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) masks are increasingly critical components to the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. This investment will position IMS to capture the significant market opportunity for multi-beam mask writing tools by accelerating innovation and enabling deeper cross-industry collaboration.\n",
            "“The advancement of lithography is critical to driving continued progress in the semiconductor industry, and mask writing plays a central role in the industry’s transition to new patterning technologies, such as high-NA EUV,” said Matt Poirier, senior vice president of Corporate Development at Intel. “Bain Capital’s investment and partnership will provide IMS with increased independence and bring strategic perspective to help accelerate the next phase of lithography technology innovation, ultimately benefitting the ecosystem as a whole.”\n",
            "Platzgummer said, “We are pleased to gain a valuable partner in Bain Capital, which has a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. They share our conviction in the meaningful opportunity ahead for IMS as EUV becomes more pervasive and high-NA EUV moves from development into high-volume manufacturing in the second half of the decade. We look forward to expanding our ability to support the world’s largest chip producers, who rely on our technology to produce current and next generations of semiconductor products.”\n",
            "Marvin Larbi-Yeboa, a partner at Bain Capital, said, “As the global leader and innovator of emerging technologies in the semiconductor fabrication and nanotech industries, we believe IMS is well-positioned to capitalize on attractive secular tailwinds as additional chip production capacity comes online and build on its leading competitive position, tech differentiation and cutting-edge product capabilities.”\n",
            "Will Tetler, a managing director at Bain Capital, added, “We look forward to partnering with IMS’ exceptional management team and Intel to employ our deep industry experience and value-creation capabilities to support the business’ long-term growth strategy through further investment in its leading-edge tech and product portfolio to enable IMS to extend its competitive market position.”\n",

            "Bot: By Jordan Finneseth\n",
            "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock,\n",
            "discussed his views on where blockchain technology is headed at the New York Times’ 2022 Dealbook Summit held on Nov. 30, saying that the future for global markets will be tokenization.\n",
            "In response to a line of questioning from New York Times journalist Andrew Sorkin that revolved around exchange-traded funds (ETF), Fink suggested that while he sees ETFs as the driving force behind the previous evolution in investing, tokenization will power the next one.\n",
            "“I believe the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities,” Fink said. “Think about instantaneous settlement [of] bonds and stocks, no middlemen, we’re going to bring down fees even more dramatically,” he explained.\n",
            "Tokenization refers to the process where a digital representation of an asset is created on a blockchain and used to verify its authenticity and track its ownership history. This technology can be applied to all manner of assets – including stocks, bonds, real estate, art and other rare collectibles.\n",
            "Despite viewing the technology as transformative, the BlackRock CEO said that its further development and integration wouldn’t hurt the business model of the world’s largest asset management firm.\n",
            "Fink also suggested that while the future is in tokenization, the majority of projects that currently exist wouldn’t be able to benefit from its integration into wider society, saying that most crypto-related companies “are not going to be around” in the future.\n",
            "This outlook is especially relevant for crypto exchanges that launch their own tokens, such as Binance, Crypto.com and the now-bankrupt FTX exchange.\n",
            "Speaking more specifically about the ongoing collapse of FTX, Fink suggested that the crypto exchange failed because it created and leveraged its own FTX Token (FTT). This created a degree of centralization that put the platform at odds with the “whole foundation of what crypto is,” he said.\n",
            "Despite this belief that it was FTX’s self-created token that led to its downfall, he still feels that crypto and the blockchain technology that underpins it will be revolutionary.\n",
            "The BlackRock CEO admitted that his firm had a $24 million investment in FTX, but emphasized that it was held in a subsidiary “fund of funds” and not in the “core part” of BlackRock’s business.\n",
            "Fink also pushed back against allegations that BlackRock, as well as other venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital, failed to do their proper due diligence before investing in the exchange.\n",
            "“Right now, we can make all the judgment calls that it looked like there was some misbehavior of major consequence […] if you look at the Sequoias of the world, they’ve had unbelievable returns over a long period of time, I am sure they did due diligence,” he said.\n",
            "BlackRock has become increasingly more involved in the crypto industry over the past couple of years. On Sept. 27, the firm announced the\n",
            "launch of an ETF that would give investors exposure to 35 blockchain-related companies, and on Nov. 3, BlackRock announced that it was selected to manage the reserve fund for Circle’s USD Coin (USDC).\n",

            "Bot: Earlier this month, a federal jury in the United States found that Hermès' Birkin trade mark was infringed by the artist Mason Rothschild, creator of a range of digital images depicting faux fur handbags, and associated non-fungible tokens ('NFTs'), referred to as 'MetaBirkins'.\n",
            "The dispute between Hermès and Rothschild has become a high-profile example of the potential for infringement of IP rights by creators and users of the expanding range of virtual platforms known as the 'Metaverse'.\n",
            "Brands in the Metaverse\n",
            "As explained by an article on the Merriam-Webster dictionary's website, the concept of the metaverse is that of \"a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play, and work.\" At present, there are several metaverses provided by competing platforms including Horizon Worlds, operated by the social networking company Meta (the parent company which operates Facebook and Instagram), and video games such as Roblox and Minecraft.\n",
            "Metaverse platforms are characterised by the existence of user-created content, including virtual products and even spaces designed to evoke a 'real-life' equivalent. These virtual worlds are becoming increasingly 'branded', with companies creating spaces dominated by their brand's imagery and allowing users to view and purchase virtual products.\n",
            "A high-profile recent example is the launch of Nikeland, accessible via the Roblox platform, visited by over 7 million users in its first five months. Visitors to Nikeland are able to view and 'try on' virtual Nike sneakers as well as play branded games to compete for virtual rewards.\n",
            "What lessons can be learned from the MetaBirkins case?\n",
            "In the MetaBirkins case, Hermès was able to convince a jury that Rothschild's range of digital images and NFTs were not solely works of art but instead were sold in a manner that would confuse consumers as to their origin. Rothschild was also held to have been liable for 'cybersquatting' through his registration and use of the domain name metabirkins.com.\n",
            "In particular, the sale of NFTs linked to the digital images appears to have been a determining factor in the jury's decision to find in favour of Hermès. This could suggest that, in a virtual space where brand imagery is displayed, but virtual goods are not actually being sold, a brand owner may find it more difficult to prove that their trade mark registration covering physical goods has been infringed.\n",
            "The verdict suggests that brand owners (and particularly larger companies like Hermès who can prove that their trade mark has a reputation) can enforce rights infringed in the metaverse in certain circumstances. It does, however, highlight the risk posed by infringing acts in the metaverse to owners of trade mark registrations that cover physical goods, but not their digital equivalents.\n",
            "How can brand owners protect themselves?\n",
            "A trade mark registration covering virtual goods and related software would provide a valuable layer of protection to brand owners concerned by appropriation of their trade marks, particularly on virtual goods designed to replicate a real-life product. This is especially the case for brand owners who may struggle to prove that their trade marks are sufficiently well-known to have enhanced distinctive character by virtue of a reputation.\n",
            "A cautionary tale, however, has arisen from the EU IPO, which recently refused an application by Burberry for a depiction of its famous tartan-check pattern in respect of a variety of virtual goods. The refusal was on the basis that the pattern could be considered a generic surface decoration when applied to virtual clothing or other 'wearable' virtual products.\n",
            "The Examiner observed, in the refusal (based on Article 7(1)(b) EUTMR) that:\n",
            "\"The Office notes that the consumer's perceptions for real-world goods can be applied to equivalent virtual goods as a key aspect of virtual goods is to emulate core concepts of real-world goods.\"\n",
            "The EU IPO's practice may not deter brand owners from seeking to protect non-traditional trade marks in relation to virtual goods, even if these might be refused protection for their physical equivalents. The metaverse is, after all, a developing concept and consumer expectations of content within it will change over time.\n",
